Analysis of VCF: round_1.vcf
Reference FASTA: Pfalciparum_3D7.fasta

Target contig: NC_004331.3
Codon 580 genomic positions: (1725260, 1725261, 1725262) (1-based)
Reference codon (genome): ACA -> T

No variants found overlapping the codon positions.

Possible mutated codons (from VCF SNP alts):
  REF: ACA -> T   (reference)

Result:
C580Y NOT FOUND in this VCF.
No relevant SNPs were present at the middle base (expected G->A) of the codon.
